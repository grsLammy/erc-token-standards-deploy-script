# AUTOMATED TEST FOR ZKEVM SMART CONTRACTS

This repository contains all the necessary unit test scripts using Mocha for zkEVM smart contracts.

## GETTING STARTED
- Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/integrations-Polygon/zkEVM_automated_testing.git
```
- Navigate to `zkEVM_automated_testing` folder
```sh
cd zkEVM_automated_testing
```

- Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```

- Create `.env` file
```sh
cp .example.env .env
```

- Configure environment variables in `.env`
```
PRIVATE_KEY = your_private_key
ZKEVM_RPC_URL = your_zkevm_rpc_url
MNEMONICS = provided_mnemonics
```
- Compile the smart contract and its types
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```
## USAGE
Start the unit testing script by running this command
```javascript
npm run test
```
While the testing is in process it will initially display all the balances in the 5 testing wallet addresses provided by the given mnemonics, if any of the wallet addresses has 0 ETH then the testing will be terminated and either you can fund the addresses with some ETH or you can contact us to fund for you.
